There is no setup or configuration required and no need to modify the way you access the service. The data is automatically and transparently decrypted when read by an authorized user.
With server-side encryption, Google manages the cryptographic keys on your behalf using the same hardened key management systems that we use for our own encrypted data, including strict key access controls and auditing. Each Firestore object's data and metadata is encrypted under the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard, and each encryption key is itself encrypted with a regularly rotated set of master keys.",,JifUniversal
